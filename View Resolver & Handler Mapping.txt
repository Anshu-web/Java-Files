					View Resolver Classes

There are many view resolver classes.

Spring provides view resolvers, which enable you to render models in a browser without tying you to a specific view
 technology. ... The two interfaces which are important to the way Spring handles views are ViewResolver and View . 
The ViewResolver provides a mapping between view names and actual views.

HandlerMapping is an interface that defines a mapping between requests and handler objects. While Spring MVC 
framework provides some ready-made implementations, the interface can be implemented by developers to provide 
customized mapping strategy
