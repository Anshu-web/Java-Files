   
   ==  Serialization means converting the object state into persistent state(binary format).
   ===Saving he state of an object.
== use of objectoutputstream. writeobject() method is used.

==class should implement Serializable interface
==By default primitive data types and String implement Serializable interface
==Every member in any class should implement Serializable interface if not then shuld be taken care of manually.

===================================================De-Serialization ===

 De-Serialization means converting the persistent state into object state.
=== ObjectInpuStream
=== readobject()
== While De-Serialization constructor does not gets called.

=======================================================Version ID=================

==In case if the serial version id is not included then by default VersionId is included at run time.
But this fails for any changes in the class.

==Version ID at the time of serialization is matched with Version ID at the time of De-serilization.

==If it does not match then exception is araised that is incompatible class.

==Version ID is 64-bit hash of class name, Interface, methods and member variable.

========================================Serialization in inheritance========================

In case if sub-class implements serializable but super class does not then member variable of super class does not involve in 
serialization and de-serialization.
==But in this case, defaultwriteObject() and defaultReadObject() need to be included in sub-class.

-===============================================Externalization================

==This is one of the ways to do the serialization.
==No arg constructor is mandatory.
==Version ID may or may not be there.
==ReadExternal and WriteExternal method is included in class.
==If in case super class does not implement the serilizable interface
