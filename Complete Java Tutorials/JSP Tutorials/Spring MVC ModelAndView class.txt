The final interface to pass values to a view is the ModelAndView.

This interface allows us to pass all the information required by Spring MVC in one return:


@GetMapping("/goToViewPage")
public ModelAndView passParametersWithModelAndView() {
    ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("viewPage"); viewPage is a jsp file and has been set as View.
    modelAndView.addObject("message", "Baeldung");
    return modelAndView;
}


@GetMapping("/goToViewPage")    // So, ModelAndView returns two things model(data) and view.
public ModelAndView home() {
    ModelAndView mv= new ModelAndView();
   mv.addObject("name", myName);
   mv.setViewName("home");     //home is a jsp file and has been set as View.
    return modelAndView;
}
