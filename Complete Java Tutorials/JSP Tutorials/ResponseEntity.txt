*****************ResponseEntity**********************************

ResponseEntity represents the whole HTTP response: status code, headers, and body.
Because of it, we can use it to fully configure the HTTP response.

@GetMapping("/hello")
ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
    return new ResponseEntity<>("Hello World!", HttpStatus.OK);
}


return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.OK);

//When you pass only one argument to the ResponseEntity constructor it considers that as status 
to be sent to the client in the response.

******************************************************************************

return new ResponseEntity<>(true,HttpStatus.OK);

//When you pass two arguments to the ResponseEntity constructor it considers the first argument as response body
and the second argument as the status to be sent to the client in the response.

Httpheaders httpheaders=new Httpheaders();
httpheaders.add("key1","value1");
httpheaders.add("key1","value1");

******************************************************************************
return new ResponseEntity<>(true,httpheaders,HttpStatus.OK);

//When you pass three arguments to the ResponseEntity constructor it considers the first argument as response body
and the second argument as the http headers and the third argument as status to be sent to the client in the response.
