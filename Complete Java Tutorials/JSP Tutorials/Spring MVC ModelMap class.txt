The advantage of ModelMap is it gives us the ability to pass a collection of values and treat these values
 as if they were within a Map:


@GetMapping("/printViewPage")
public String passParametersWithModelMap(ModelMap map) {
    map.addAttribute("welcomeMessage", "welcome");
    map.addAttribute("message", "Baeldung");

   map.put();//This is also one of the methods present in modelmap to add the data.

    return "viewPage";



}
