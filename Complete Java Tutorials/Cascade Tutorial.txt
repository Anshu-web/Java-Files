The cascade types supported by the Java Persistence Architecture are as below:

CascadeType.PERSIST : cascade type presist means that save() or persist() operations cascade to related entities.

CascadeType.MERGE : cascade type merge means that related entities are merged when the owning entity is merged.

CascadeType.REFRESH : cascade type refresh does the same thing for the refresh() operation.

CascadeType.REMOVE : cascade type remove removes all related entities association with this setting when the owning entity
 is deleted.
CascadeType.DETACH : cascade type detach detaches all related entities if a “manual detach” occurs.
